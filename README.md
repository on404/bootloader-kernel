## Overview
This project showcases a minimalistic implementation of a bootloader and kernel, designed for educational purposes in understanding low-level system initialization and basic operating system principles.

## Components

### 1. Bootloader

- **File**: `bootloader.asm`

### 2. Kernel

- **Files**: 
  - `kernel.asm`: Entry point for the kernel and print msg.

## Notes
- This project serves as a foundational example and is not intended for production environments.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the provided codebase for learning and experimentation purposes.
